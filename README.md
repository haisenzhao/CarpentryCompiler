# PartDesign for Carpentry Compiler [Project page](https://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/carpentrycompiler/)

Our carpentry compiler converts high-level geometric designs made by users to low-level fabrication instructions that can be directly followed to manufacture parts. The compiler performs multi-objective optimization on the low-level instructions to generate Pareto-optimal candidates.

# Usage
1, Download "FreeCADLibs_12.1.4_x64_VC15" from https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/releases/tag/0.19_pre;   
Extract the package to the local path, "D:\Develop\FreeCADLibs_12.1.4_x64_VC15".

2, Clone FreeCAD with "git clone https://github.com/chenming-wu/FreeCAD.git"  to the local path, "D:\Develop\FreeCAD";

3, Clone this repository by "git clone https://github.com/haisenzhao/Testing.git" to the local path  "D:\Develop\Testing";  
Replace the content of "D:\Develop\FreeCAD\src\Mod\PartDesign" with "D:\Develop\Testing". Now we have only tried to compiler our framework on Windows operating system.

4, Build FreeCAD code with CMake:

    4.1 Set FREECAD_LIBPACK_DIR as the path of "FreeCADLibs_12.1.4_x64_VC15";

    4.2 Checked "BUILD_QT5";

    4.2 Configure and generate;
 
    4.3 Build to the local path, "D:\Develop\FreeCAD\build\";

5, Copy the following code into "D:\Develop\FreeCAD\src\Gui\ApplicationPy.cpp" after line #1090;
       
	if (icon.isNull())  
	{  
		QString file = QString::fromUtf8(content.c_str());  
		icon.load(file);  
		if (icon.isNull()) {  
			// ... or the name of another icon?  
			icon = BitmapFactory().pixmap(file.toUtf8());  
		}  
	}

6, Compiler FreeCAD with Visual Studio;

7, Copy some files into building folder:

     7.1. Copy the whole folder of "D:\Develop\Testing\Ext\asm3" into "D:\Develop\FreeCAD\build\Ext\freecad";  
          *"asm3" is a python-based mode for assembling;   
          https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD_assembly3

     7.2. Copy "carpentry_geom.dll" and "libgmp-10.dll" into "D:\Develop\FreeCAD\build\bin";  
          *"carpentry_geom.dll" includes some basic geometric functions using CGAL, et al.
         
          If you need new geometric functions, you could build the project of "carpentry-geom-lib",  
	  https://github.com/helm-compiler/carpentry-geom-lib;
	     
     7.3. Copy all files in "E:\Develop\FreeCADLibs_12.1.4_x64_VC15\bin" into "D:\Develop\FreeCAD\build\bin";
     
     7.4 Copy the folder of "E:\Develop\FreeCADLibs_12.1.4_x64_VC15\plugins\platforms" into "D:\Develop\FreeCAD\build\bin";

8, Run;
